function idetification
address of functions
to prevent malicious code, they are removed on deployment

why is it important? many techniques depend on this

similarly to the flow of our research
template -> learning

why does generality matter? different architectures

due to conflicts and uncertainty, 

explains in simple terms -> shows examples the problem itself is not simple
their dataset provides generality
