### Paper 1: SRS
SRS, software requirement specifications

original approaches: checks NL semantics

* naÃ¯ve input of data

trustability
* accuracy
* consistency

### Paper 2: UML seq
problems in NL -> txt2img
NL -> UML + img

verb-focused 

suggested this automated approach can be applied "consistent" software generation
* but a lot of tokens from the requirements are removed so will this be effective?

**main point**: approach black box generative-AIs from a SE-perspective

### Papaer 3: safety requirement extraction from software

Very effective delivery

Mainly works with STPA, due its limit to sensing the root of cause (ex: monitoring failed), FTA is also used
FMEA is for defining severity

comments: it will be better to specify how these approaches are integrated in the software lifecycle
