Example of active-low connection:

```
VCC - (+LED-) - D0
```

- For a LED to light up, the `potential` of the flow from (+) to (-) has to always be HIGH to LOW.

For the case of the example, `VCC` acts as a power source (always HIGH). Therefore, for the LED to light up, `D0` has to be LOW. Which makes it active-low
